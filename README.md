Exercises. It is probably a good time to pause and test your understanding with a few
simple exercises. Before reading further, try to solve the following problems.
1. Write a function bool search(const vector<int>& V, int x); that searches vector
V for value x.

2. Write a function void reverse(vector<int>& V); that reverses the order of the ele-
ments of V.

3. Given a vector of integers V, write code that creates a new vector E which contains only
the even elements of V. That is, if V = {1,3,5,2,7,8}, then W should be {2,8}.
4. Given a vector V of sorted integers, write code that creates another vector U which is like
V, but without duplicate elements. For example, if the input is V = [1,2,2,3,3,3],
then U should be set to contain [1,2,3].
